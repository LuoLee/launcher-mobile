### Building

#### Dependencies

The easiest way to get the dependencies needed for both apps, is to use our [Cerbero fork](https://github.com/flexVDI/cerbero). Something like this should do the trick:

 * For both platforms
```shell
mkdir source
cd source
git clone https://github.com/flexvdi/cerbero
cd cerbero
```

 * For iOS
```shell
./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-ios-universal.cbc bootstrap
./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-ios-universal.cbc build spiceglue
```

 * For Android
```
./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-android-armv7.cbc bootstrap
./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-android-armv7.cbc build spiceglue
./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-android-x86.cbc bootstrap
./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-android-x86.cbc build spiceglue
```

#### Building the iOS App

 * Open the iOSLauncher project with Xcode
 * In **Frameworks**, replace all static library dependencies, with the ones built with Cerbero
 * Build the project


####Â Building the Android App

 * Go to **AndroidLauncher/app/jni/deps**, and for each architecture, copy the files indicated in the *README* file, from your Cerbero binary path, to those directories.
 * From **AndroidLauncher/app/jni**, run `ndk-build`
 * From **AndroidLauncher/app**, run `./gradlew nativeLibsToJar`
 * Open the **AndroidLauncher** project with AndroidStudio, and build the app
